# 9TD

##By _David Tumpowsky_

## `Description`

9TD takes place on a 4x4 grid. A token is dropped along a column and said token goes to the lowest unoccupied row of the board. A player wins when they have 4 tokens next to each other either along a row, in a column, or on adiagonal. If the board is filled, and nobody has won then the game is a draw. Each player takes a turn, starting with player 1, until the game reaches either win or draw.
